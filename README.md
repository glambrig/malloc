# Allocating memory has never been so... fun?
### COUGH COUGGH HUUHHH COUGH COUGH COUGHHHH

In this project, we'll implement some classic libc memory management functions:
- malloc()
- free()
- realloc()

This is done by making use of some special syscalls to map and unmap the memory (more on that later).
